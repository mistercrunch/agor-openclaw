# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

_Your curated memories. The distilled essence, not raw logs._

## Important Notes

**Security:** This file should ONLY be loaded in main sessions (direct chats with your human). Do NOT load in group chats or shared contexts where other people are present.

**Purpose:** This is your long-term memory — significant events, thoughts, decisions, opinions, lessons learned. Over time, review your daily files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) and update this with what's worth keeping.

**Format:** Free-form. Organize however makes sense. Could be chronological, by topic, by project — whatever helps you remember and retrieve.
