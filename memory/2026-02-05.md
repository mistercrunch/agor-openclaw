### Memory Sync Status

**Comparing current state vs memory/agor-state/worktrees.json:**

**Last synced:** 2026-02-04T20:05:00Z (~5.5 hours ago)

**Discrepancies:**
1. **PR #535 zone mismatch note now obsolete** - PR was actually merged at 05:29:40Z

## Board Cleanup & Cosmetic Improvements (02:00-02:08 UTC Feb 5)

**Session ID:** 820b322a-87ab-4964-b3f2-780bca8ef6fc
**Worktree:** first-session (e3276fdf-5296-4195-93f7-bd5971d67409)

### Board Status Sync

**Confirmed:** All worktrees on agor-claw repo have been completed/archived
- improve-framework-template: PR #2 merged at 23:17:42Z Feb 4
- Total active worktrees on our board: 1 (first-session only)
- Board is completely clean

### Board Cosmetic Improvements

**Problem:** 4 side-by-side workflow zones had inconsistent widths and spacing
- Agor Coding Tasks: 654.78px
- Create a pull request: 585.42px
- Codex review: 601.99px
- Human review: 890.38px (widest)

**Solution:** Aligned all zones with equal widths and consistent padding
- New width: 687.5px each
- Padding between zones: 40px
- Positions: x=-460, 267.5, 995, 1722.5
- All at y=980, height=1860

**Visual improvements:**
- Background colors: Changed from opaque (#2a1810, etc.) to low-alpha transparency (#ff6b351a, etc.)
- Border colors: Made fully opaque (added ff suffix)
- Result: Clean, vibrant borders with subtle background tints

**MCP operations:**
1. `agor_boards_update` - Set equal widths and spacing
2. `agor_boards_update` - Adjusted background alphas to 1a (10% opacity)
3. `agor_boards_update` - Made borders fully opaque (ff = 100%)

### Memory Sync

Updated `memory/agor-state/worktrees.json`:
- Moved improve-framework-template to archived_worktrees
- Updated last_synced timestamp
- Added board_cosmetics_updated note
- Confirmed board_completely_clean status

**Total PRs merged in 48-hour window:**
- 11 preset-io/agor PRs
- 1 mistercrunch/agor-openclaw PR
- **12 total contributions**

**System Status: EXCELLENT - Board clean, all PRs merged, cosmetics polished**
