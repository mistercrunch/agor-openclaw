### Issues Identified

**Critical discrepancies found:**

1. **Branch mismatch** - Git says we're on 'private' branch, Agor worktree says 'first-session'
2. **New worktrees not tracked** - fix-zone-pinning-mcp-bug (69af88d7) has PR #541 but not in memory
3. **require-boardid PR** - PR #540 not tracked in memory (created during last session 820b322a)
4. **PR #541 linked to first-session worktree** - Our worktree (e3276fdf) has pull_request_url pointing to PR #541

**Observations:**
1. ⚠️ **3 PRs awaiting review:** #535, #539, #540
2. ⚠️ **Memory out of sync:** Missing recent worktrees and PRs
3. ⚠️ **Branch confusion:** Working tree on 'private', Agor metadata says 'first-session'
4. ✅ **No stuck sessions:** All sessions idle or running normally
5. ⚠️ **Needs attention flag:** fix-zone-pinning-mcp (a6ead017) flagged

### Summary

**Overall Status: NEEDS SYNC ⚠️**

**Active work:**
- 3 PRs awaiting review (#535, #539, #540)
- Recent bug fix work on zone pinning MCP tool (PR #541)
- 4 PRs successfully merged and in production (#533, #536, #537, #538)

**Memory sync required:**
- Update worktrees.json with new worktrees
- Track PR #540 and #541
- Clarify branch state (private vs first-session)

**No critical blockers.** System functional, memory tracking needs update.
