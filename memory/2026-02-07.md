_Heartbeat #20 complete. Next scheduled: 2026-02-07T18:00:00Z_
# Daily Log: 2026-02-07

## Task Duration UI Bug Fix (09:33 PST Feb 7 / 17:33 UTC Feb 7)

**Session ID:** 933632d7-feb6-45ab-8b6d-a41d732c3aaf
**Worktree:** first-session (e3276fdf-5296-4195-93f7-bd5971d67409)

### Task: Fix Task Duration Display in Conversation View

**Context:** Max reports a UI bug where task duration widgets in the conversation view always show "00:00" for previous/completed tasks, but work correctly while tasks are running.

**Problem Description:**
- **Works correctly:** Duration updates while task is running (shows elapsed time)
- **Bug:** Previous/completed tasks all show "00:00" instead of actual duration
- **Location:** Task header in conversation view

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
Duration calculation likely uses current time (`Date.now()`) instead of task completion timestamp for completed tasks, resulting in 0 or negative duration.

**New Worktree Created:**
- **Name:** fix-task-duration-display
- **ID:** 1c8dbe72-ffa5-424b-9c7e-0c1274d52240
- **Repo:** preset-io/agor (5e4aa6a8-0b4a-47a5-be06-2c3fb3308a6a)
- **Branch:** fix-task-duration-display (based on main)
- **Board:** "Agor Claw Experiment" (9833703b-b9e6-4b7b-b0eb-70f783fba715)
- **Zone:** ✅ "Agor Coding Tasks" (zone-1770144681071) - placed correctly!
- **Status:** ready

**Investigation Session Created:**
- **Session ID:** 96932eed-24bf-4ca5-94a1-5ba8a54d8e04
- **Title:** Fix Task Duration Display Bug
- **Task ID:** 774de234-385b-4248-85a6-9ed8b7f75882
- **Unix User:** max
- **Model:** claude-opus-4-6 (auto thinking mode)
- **Permission Mode:** bypassPermissions

**Investigation Goals:**
1. Find task duration component in UI codebase
2. Identify why completed tasks show "00:00"
3. Fix calculation to use actual elapsed time for completed tasks
4. Verify running tasks still work correctly
5. Test fix with both running and completed tasks

**Expected Fix:**
- Use task completion timestamp (not current time) for completed tasks
- Calculate: `duration = completed_at - created_at` for completed tasks
- Keep existing logic for running tasks: `duration = Date.now() - created_at`

**Lesson Applied:**
✅ Remembered to place worktree in "Agor Coding Tasks" zone immediately after creation using `worktrees_set_zone` - this is the correct workflow per BOARD.md!

## Fix GitHub Issue #565 (09:38 PST Feb 7 / 17:38 UTC Feb 7)

**Session ID:** 933632d7-feb6-45ab-8b6d-a41d732c3aaf

### Task: Fix agor init crashes with AGOR_DB_DIALECT=postgresql

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/preset-io/agor/issues/565
**Title:** agor init crashes when AGOR_DB_DIALECT=postgresql is set in environment

**Problem Description:**
`agor init` fails with `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432` when `AGOR_DB_DIALECT=postgresql` is set in the environment. The command should create a local SQLite database regardless of the environment variable.

**Root Cause:**
In `apps/agor-cli/src/commands/init.ts` (lines 348, 370, 530), the code calls:
```typescript
const db = createDatabase({ url: `file:${dbPath}` });
```

Without specifying `dialect: 'sqlite'`, the function falls through to `getDatabaseDialect()` which reads `AGOR_DB_DIALECT=postgresql` from environment and tries to use Postgres driver with a SQLite file URL, causing connection failure.

**Fix:**
Explicitly pass `dialect: 'sqlite'` in all `createDatabase()` calls in init.ts:
```typescript
const db = createDatabase({ url: `file:${dbPath}`, dialect: 'sqlite' });
```

**New Worktree Created:**
- **Name:** fix-agor-init-postgres-dialect
- **ID:** 16146a7b-0bba-4452-b996-12251869e1f3
- **Repo:** preset-io/agor (5e4aa6a8-0b4a-47a5-be06-2c3fb3308a6a)

- **Zone:** ✅ "Agor Coding Tasks" (zone-1770144681071)
- **Issue URL:** https://github.com/preset-io/agor/issues/565
- **Status:** ready

**Investigation Session Created:**
- **Session ID:** 8cc49105-671a-452c-a6e8-a437648dace2
- **Title:** Fix: agor init crashes with AGOR_DB_DIALECT=postgresql
- **Task ID:** 3ef4b61d-1584-40ff-9882-d9badc90f343
- **Unix User:** max
- **Model:** claude-opus-4-6 (auto thinking mode)
- **Permission Mode:** bypassPermissions

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Read `apps/agor-cli/src/commands/init.ts`
2. Locate all `createDatabase()` calls (lines ~348, ~370, ~530)
3. Add `dialect: 'sqlite'` parameter to each call
4. Verify the fix works
5. Test that init works with AGOR_DB_DIALECT=postgresql set

**Expected Outcome:**
- `agor init` works correctly regardless of AGOR_DB_DIALECT environment variable
- SQLite database is always created for local workspace
- Issue #565 is resolved

## Fix GitHub Issue #566 (09:40 PST Feb 7 / 17:40 UTC Feb 7)

**Session ID:** 933632d7-feb6-45ab-8b6d-a41d732c3aaf

### Task: Fix PostgreSQL SSL Configuration

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/preset-io/agor/issues/566
**Title:** ssl: config.ssl disables URL-based sslmode when config.ssl is undefined — breaks hosted PostgreSQL providers

**Problem Description:**
Connecting to hosted PostgreSQL providers (Neon, Supabase, AWS RDS) that require SSL fails with "connection is insecure" even when `sslmode=require` is specified in the DATABASE_URL.

**Root Cause:**
In `packages/core/src/db/client.ts` line 203-212, the `createPostgresDatabase()` function passes:
```typescript
ssl: config.ssl,  // Always undefined
```

postgres.js treats an explicitly-present `ssl: undefined` differently from an absent `ssl` key. When present (even as undefined), it overrides the URL's `sslmode=require`, effectively disabling SSL.

**Fix Options:**
- **Option A (Conservative):** Only include ssl key when explicitly set (let URL control SSL)
- **Option B (Safer):** Default to `ssl: 'require'` when not set

**Recommendation:** Option A to preserve backward compatibility while fixing the bug.

**New Worktree Created:**
- **Name:** fix-postgres-ssl-config
- **ID:** e9e3e7d9-f312-4653-bfed-3df9cc4a6306

- **Unix User:** max
- **Model:** claude-opus-4-6 (auto thinking mode)
- **Permission Mode:** bypassPermissions

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Read `packages/core/src/db/client.ts`
2. Find `createPostgresDatabase()` function
3. Implement Option A: conditionally include ssl key
4. Test that URL-based sslmode works
5. Verify explicit config.ssl values still work

**Expected Outcome:**
- Hosted PostgreSQL providers with SSL requirements work correctly
- URL-based `sslmode=require` is respected
- Issue #566 is resolved

## Update Codex Model Dropdown (09:52 PST Feb 7 / 17:52 UTC Feb 7)

**Worktree:** first-session (e3276fdf-5296-4195-93f7-bd5971d67409)

### Task: Add Latest Codex Models to Dropdown

**Context:** Max reports that the Codex/OpenAI model dropdown is missing newer models like Codex 5.2 and possibly Codex 5.3.

**Problem Description:**
The model selection dropdown for Codex/OpenAI sessions doesn't include the latest available models. Users may not be able to select newer, better-performing models.

**Missing Models (suspected):**
- Codex 5.2
- Codex 5.3 (if available)
- Possibly other recent OpenAI models

- **Name:** update-codex-model-dropdown

- **Unix User:** max
- **Model:** claude-opus-4-6 (auto thinking mode)
- **Permission Mode:** bypassPermissions

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Find where Codex/OpenAI model options are defined (UI components, config files)
2. Research what Codex models are currently available
3. Add missing models to the dropdown list
4. Ensure model identifiers are correct
5. Test that dropdown shows new models and selection works

**Expected Outcome:**
- Dropdown includes Codex 5.2 (if available)
- Dropdown includes Codex 5.3 (if available)
- Any other missing recent models are added
- Model selection works correctly for new models

---

### Actions Taken During This Heartbeat

**Zone Movements:**
1. ✅ Moving fix-postgres-ssl-config to Done zone (PR #568 merged)
2. ✅ Moving fix-agor-init-postgres-dialect to Done zone (PR #567 merged)

### Stats

**Worktrees by zone (our board only):**
- MAIN SESH: 1
- Agor Coding Tasks: 0 ✨ (clean!)
- Create a pull request: 0 ✨ (clean!)
- Codex review: 2 (both active)
- Human review: 0 ✨ (clean!)

### Heartbeat Performance

**Automation status:** ✅ Perfect
