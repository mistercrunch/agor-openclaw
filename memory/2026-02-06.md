## Heartbeat Check #12 (09:26 PST Feb 6 / 17:26 UTC Feb 6)

**Session ID:** 61c07fb2-0321-46d0-a895-455f4fd7c842 (child of ebe98a1b)
**Worktree:** first-session (e3276fdf-5296-4195-93f7-bd5971d67409)
**Requested by:** Human (manual heartbeat check #4)

### Context Since Last Heartbeat

**Last heartbeat:** #11 at 2026-02-06T02:41 UTC (~15 hours ago)
**Gap:** 15 hours since last heartbeat (expected 2-4 hour intervals)
**Note:** This is heartbeat #12 overall, but labeled "#4" by user (counting manual heartbeats separately from automated ones)

### Critical Discovery: Scheduler Issues

**AUTOMATED HEARTBEATS ARE BROKEN!**

**Evidence:**
- 3 scheduled sessions created but never executed:
  - 06c7f377 (scheduled 17:06 UTC) - ready_for_prompt=true, 0 messages
  - 0a55aa78 (scheduled 17:08 UTC) - ready_for_prompt=true, 0 messages
  - 25cbf1c6 (scheduled 17:24 UTC) - ready_for_prompt=true, 0 messages
- All show `scheduled_from_worktree: true` but remain stuck at ready_for_prompt
- Scheduler creating sessions but not sending the prompt to execute

**Active Fix in Progress:**
- fix-scheduler-task-failures (186f3df5) worktree created at 17:00 UTC
- In "Agor Coding Tasks" zone
- Has needs_attention=true flag
- **This is actively being worked on!**

### New Activity Since Last Heartbeat (#11 at 02:41 UTC)

**Time elapsed:** ~15 hours

**NEW WORKTREES (4):**
1. fix-timestamp-bigint (3af277bb) - PR #556
2. upgrade-agent-sdks-clis (e2dbd328) - PR #557
3. fix-duplicate-schedule-toast (f1b3b2a9) - no PR yet
4. fix-scheduler-task-failures (186f3df5) - no PR yet, **CRITICAL FIX**

**ZONE MOVEMENTS:**
- fix-env-docker moved from Codex review → Human review (PR #555 still open)

**SCHEDULER BREAKDOWN DISCOVERED:**
- 3 automated heartbeat sessions created but not executed
- Scheduler creating sessions but not prompting them
- Active work happening to fix (fix-scheduler-task-failures)

### Issues Identified

**CRITICAL:**
1. 🔥 **Scheduler broken** - Automated heartbeats creating sessions but not executing
2. 🔥 **15-hour gap in heartbeats** - Should be 2-4 hours, scheduler failure explains this

**Memory Out of Sync:**
3. ⚠️ **4 new worktrees not in tracking**
4. ⚠️ **New PRs #555, #556, #557 not in tracking**

**Zone Issues:**
5. ⚠️ **oauth-mcp-review zone mismatch** - Different board but shows on ours
6. ⚠️ **amin-private1 on our board** - Different user's worktree

**Positive Observations:**
- ✅ Fix already in progress (fix-scheduler-task-failures)
- ✅ All previous PRs remain merged and stable
- ✅ Manual heartbeat still working fine
- ✅ Active development continues (4 new worktrees)
- ✅ No stuck sessions from our work
- ✅ Board organization clear and functional

### Pull Request Status Summary

**Merged (in production) - 18 preset-io/agor PRs:**
(All from HB#11 tracking - no new merges)

**Open PRs (3):**
- 📝 PR #555 - Fix HOME override (Human review)
- 📝 PR #556 - Fix timestamp bigint (Codex review)
- 📝 PR #557 - Upgrade agent SDKs/CLIs (Codex review)

**Active Development (no PR yet - 2):**
- 🔨 fix-duplicate-schedule-toast (f1b3b2a9)
- 🔨 fix-scheduler-task-failures (186f3df5) **← CRITICAL FIX**

**Total contributions to date: 19 PRs merged** (18 preset-io/agor + 1 agor-openclaw)

### Summary

**Overall Status: SCHEDULER BROKEN BUT FIX IN PROGRESS 🔥**

**Critical Issue:**
- **Automated heartbeats completely broken** since ~17:00 UTC today
- Scheduler creates sessions but doesn't send prompts to execute them
- 3 orphaned scheduled sessions exist (ready but never run)
- **Active fix underway:** fix-scheduler-task-failures worktree created to address this

**Why This Happened:**
- Likely related to recent scheduler changes (PR #554 "Add debug logging to worktree scheduler" merged at HB#11)
- OR related to general scheduler task execution issues

**Impact:**
- Manual heartbeats still work (this one!)
- Board health good, zone organization clear
- Development continues (4 new worktrees in 15h)
- Just automated monitoring broken

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor fix-scheduler-task-failures worktree progress
2. Update memory tracking with 4 new worktrees + 3 PRs
3. Once scheduler fixed, verify automated heartbeats resume
4. Consider cleaning up 3 orphaned scheduled sessions

**Recommended Action:** Let scheduler fix complete, then verify automated heartbeats work again.
